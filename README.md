# Food_delivery_app_SQL_project
In this SQL data analysis project I have created a mock database for a food delivery app and performed data analysis using MYSQL to analyse customer purchase and product patterns and derive insights to improve sales strategies.

What is the total amount spent by each customer?
On how many days has each customer placed an order on the app?
What was the first product purchased by each customer?
What is the most purchased product and how many times has it been purchased?
Which product is the most popular for each customer?
Which was the first product purchased by customers after they became a gold member?
How many points have been earned by each customer, if 1 point = every 10 rupees spent by the customer?
Which city brings in the most revenue for the app?
